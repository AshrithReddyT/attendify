# Attendify
Meeting Scheduler and QR-Based Attendance Management System

> **Abstract:** *Managers often face challenges when scheduling important events and keeping track of the attendance of intended participants. Managers need to use multiple tools to schedule the events, keep track of past and upcoming events, and mark and monitor the attendance of participants, which can be a laborious and tedious process - especially in a fast paced work environment where managers have other important responsibilities. Managers can make light work of scheduling events and attendance management with the help of Attendify. Using the Attendify tool, managers can streamline the process and focus their efforts on other critical aspects of project management.*
